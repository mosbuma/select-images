# sorting out final images

A sorting script shell can be generated by the admin by clicking the "export script" button in the sorting overview

This script copies and renames the nft candidate files based on their ratings into included and excluded folders.
Adjust the start number for the included nfts to create a continuous series of accepted nfts before running.

Copy the script to the public/images/nft-candidates and execute from a terminal
Next create a backup copy of both folders (included + excluded) and check the results
When the rename is correct, discard the files in the nft-candidates and nft-candidates/original folders and move the files
from the included folder to nft-final.
